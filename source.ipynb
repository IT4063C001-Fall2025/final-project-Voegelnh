    "The problem I want to address is the digital divide in internet access. Although the internet is essential for education, jobs, and daily life, many households and schools especially in rural or low-income areas that still lack reliable and affordable access. This gap limits learning opportunities, reduces economic mobility, and widens social inequality. My project will analyze patterns of internet access across countries and income groups to better understand where the disparities are greatest."
