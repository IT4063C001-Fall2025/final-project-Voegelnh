# Internet Access
<!-- Edit the title above with your project title -->

## Project Overview
The problem I want to address is the digital divide in internet access. Although the internet is essential for education, jobs, and daily life, many households and schools especially in rural or low-income areas that still lack reliable and affordable access. This gap limits learning opportunities, reduces economic mobility, and widens social inequality. My project will analyze patterns of internet access across countries and income groups to better understand where the disparities are greatest.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
